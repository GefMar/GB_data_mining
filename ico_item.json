	"description" : "1KCoin is a private club of investors, with the goal of bringing friends together in a community that benefits from the experience of professional traders, but without the hassle of managing a diversified portfolio on different exchange platforms for crypto-coins, and also without the risks inherent in the lack of crypto-knowledge.\r\nYou can be part of a community that builds an ecosystem of projects, both in crypto and in classical businesses. Experienced traders will manage the crypto-funds, but also the 1KCoin financial ecosystem will include classical projects voted by the community, and those who get the majority of votes will be funded. Monthly earnings from all projects where community money was invested will be shared back into the community as dividends.",
