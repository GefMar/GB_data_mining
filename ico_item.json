	"description" : "HYGH is a peer-to-peer advertising network and content management system that connects owners of public displays with brands. The HYGH platform empowers everyone to become an advertiser, regardless of budget or company size. Any business can power up a screen and earn passive income running advertisements in their shop, hotel or restaurant.\r\n\r\nMost Digital Out of Home Advertising (DOOH) is expensive and inflexible. Most spaces require a high minimum screen buy-in and must be booked far in advance, limiting spontaneous ads. Screen ownership is largely unclear, with a lack of clarity in how to book a campaign. HYGH aims to bring affordability and order to the market.\r\n\r\nDOOH advertising is growing exponentially. OOH media revenues worldwide increased by 13% in 2018. HYGH offers the opportunity for investors to get in on the action - by investing $500 minimum in the HYGH platform, all investors receive a 9% revenue share in ad revenue.",
